 The Kingdom of Neutronia, where the unit of currency is the tvarp, has the following
 income tax code:
 first 5,000 tvarps: 0% tax
 next 10,000 tvarps: 10% tax
 next 20,000 tvarps: 15% tax
 tvarps after 35,000: 20% tax
 For example, someone earning 38,000 tvarps would owe 5,000 ¡Á 0.00 + 10,000 ¡Á 0.10
 + 20,000 ¡Á 0.15 + 3,000 ¡Á 0.20, or 4,600 tvarps. Write a program that uses a loop to
 solicit incomes and to report tax owed. The loop should terminate when the user enters
 a negative number or nonnumeric input.*/
